# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Objective

The objective of the task was to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. The user can choose if the password will include special characters, lower cases and numeric characters. 

## The process

The problem was solved the following way:

* A function generate password was declared
* An array with every upper case letter was made and an array with (almost) every special character was also made; for the lower case the function .toLowerCase() was applied to the upper case array and for the numeric characters Math.Random() was used
* A loop while was declared, in each loop checking what did the user wanted the password to include and, if it was true, concatenated to the password. 
* A break was needed to be included since the password ended up being larger than the desired length. 

## Limitation:

The solution had a main limitation: each element was added in the same pattern (first special character, then lower case, then numeric element, then upper case) and repeated itself

## Solution of the limitation:

In order to solve the limitation, a randomize function was made in which the elements within the string password were randomly swapped to eliminate the pattern issue
